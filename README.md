## SCUBA TILL YOU DROP
I can't imagine life without scubadiving. I don't know how I used to do with out it.
How do people not scuba dive?
It is just such a beautiful place to be... underwater ... breathing .. weigthless
Even in fresh water lakes with hardly any life, it is still refreshing and relaxing
But even better in nice blue tropical waters 
Swimming with tha sharks, and rays, and all the reef fish, turtles, tuna, barracuda, seahorse, frogfish, and many, many more...
It is so jawdroppingly amazing.. you can't imagine
It is AWESOME!
If I did not have to work I would scuba all day every day. Travel the world and the 7 seas..
Try a introduction dive I can recommend anyone. Do a DSD Discover Scuba Diving experience.. get in the water and experience it..
If you like it.. and chances are that you will.. get certified! Go get yourself an Open Water certification and start your diving wander
If you like it.. get more certifications, build your skill level and grow!
Get your logbook and fill it with many logged dives in beautiful places around the globe..
These are in some cases life changing dives with amazing wildlfie interactions.
Memories you will cherish for the rest of your life.
And.. if you are passionate enough.. you can become a scuba diving professional
First you will become a Divemaster or Assistant instructor, and then you can become a Open Water SCUBA Instructor.
Past that stage you can increase your instructor levels and teach more and more different courses on different levels.
Now you are not only enjoying life, but also changing other peoples lives, as they get to experience the magical aquatic world.
This is the start of a beautiful journey of personal development and making a difference!
There is just sooo much to explore, the bottom is the limit (pun intended)
This is like a parallel universe within the planet.
Come explore this majestical place with me!
