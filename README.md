## SCUBA TILL YOU DROP
I can't imagine life without scubadiving. I don't know how I used to do with out it.
How do people not scuba dive?
It is just such a beautiful place to be... underwater ... breathing .. weigthless
Even in fresh water lakes with hardly any life, it is still refreshing and relaxing
But even better in nice blue tropical waters 
Swimming with tha sharks, and rays, and all the reef fish, turtles, tuna, barracuda, seahorse, frogfish, and many, many more...
It is so jawdroppingly amazing.. you can't imagine
It is AWESOME!
